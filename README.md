This frontend application provides a user-friendly experience for customers, from exploring meal options to managing their own subscriptions, while also giving administrators powerful tools to monitor business performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the frontend running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- **A running instance of the backend server.** This frontend application cannot function without its corresponding backend API.
  - You can find the backend repository here: **[SEA Catering Backend](https://github.com/jevvonn/sea-catering-be)**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jevvonn/sea-catering-fe.git
    cd sea-catering-fe
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    This application requires the URL of the backend API. Create a `.env.local` file
    in the root of the project by copying the example:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

    Now, open `.env.local` and add the URL of your running backend server:

    ```env
    # The base URL for the backend REST API
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3001/api"
    ```

    _Note: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required to expose the variable to the browser._

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

    ### OR

5.  **Build the Next.js project**

    ```bash
     npm run build
    ```

6.  **Run the frontend project**

    ```bash
     npm start
    ```

_To access admin features, you must log in with an account that has an `ADMIN` role. Admin accounts should be created via the backend service._

## Project Structure

The project uses the Next.js App Router for a feature-colocated structure.
